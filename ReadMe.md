BBQuiz
===================

BBQuizApp was developed for a Quiz Show using an arduino and switches with HTML + Javascript as a GUI. It uses [BreakoutServer](https://github.com/soundanalogous/Breakout) and AdvancedFirmata developed by Jeff Hoefs for communication between the Arduino and the HTML/Javascript GUI. 


Setup
------

1. Make sure hardware (schematic to be uploaded) has been loaded with AdvancedFirmata
2. Open appropriate 'Breakout Server' in 'server' folder. Open connection to QuizApp hardware by clicking Connect. Something like this should appear:

        Breakout Server v0.2.3
        
        Server running on: http://computer-name:8887/
        Connected to IOBoard on: /dev/cu.usbserial-#######


3. Open BBQuiz.html in browser of choice, for more fun, switch to presentation or full screen mode.
4. It should be working properly.
