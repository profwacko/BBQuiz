How to Setup
------------

1. Make sure hardware (schematic to be uploaded) has been loaded with AdvancedFirmata
2. Place bg.jpg in folder for appropriate background
3. Open appropriate 'Breakout Server' in 'server' folder. Open connection to QuizApp hardware by clicking Connect. Something like this should appear:

```
	$ Breakout Server v0.2.3

	$ Server running on: http://joaqbook-prold:8887/
	$ Connected to IOBoard on: /dev/cu.usbserial-A6008cLV
```

4. Open BBQuiz.html in browser of choice, for more fun, switch to presentation or full screen mode.
5. It should be working properly.

Read up on BreakoutServer for the functions used in the Javascript file.
